Test 1:
nReplicas: 2
nLeaders: 2
nAcceptors:  3

Flow :
Leader 1 is master leader. Leader 0 gets preempted.

Leader 1 doesn't send ping to leader 0
Leader 0 becomes leader again

Client sends a request to both the leaders now

Leader 1 gets pre-empted when it sends the commander and starts listening to Leader 0.
Leader 0 gets the values decided and sends decision to all

How to simulate:
propose 1 cmd w 1 20
ping-timout
propose 1 cmd w 1 30 #leader:1 gets preempted here.
